Ultrasonic distance sensor
The device was realized by using the "Arduino Nano" microprocessor system using an ultrasonic sensor that registers the distance. The device is designed in such a way that the ultrasonic sensor emits an acoustic wave that is refracted from the nearest surface and thus calculates the distance between the person using the device and the nearest object (obstacles).
The program code is designed to read the result (distance) every 100ms and, based on the set conditions, checks the distance of the object to the person. According to the calculated distance, the program generates a short sound of a given frequency.If a person is getting closer to an object the frequency of the generated ultrasonic wave is greater
